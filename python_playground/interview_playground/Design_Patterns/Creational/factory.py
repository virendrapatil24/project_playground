"""
The Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects
in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

When to Use It
- When the exact type of the object isnâ€™t known until runtime.
- When you want to delegate the object creation logic to child classes.
- When your code needs to be open for extension but closed for modification (Open/Closed Principle)
- When you want to decouple the object creation logic from business logic.
