"""
The Facade Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface
to a complex subsystem. It acts as a wrapper that hides the complexity of multiple classes, libraries, or APIs.

When to Use:
- You have a complex system with many moving parts and want to provide a simple API to clients.
- You want to decouple the client from the inner workings of the subsystem.
- You want to provide a clean entry point for a library or module.
