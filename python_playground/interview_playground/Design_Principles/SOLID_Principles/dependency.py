"""
D â€” Dependency Inversion Principle

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules.
Both should depend on abstractions.

Also: Abstractions should not depend on details.
Details should depend on abstractions.

High-level Module(or Class): Class that executes an action with a tool.
Low-level Module (or Class): The tool that is needed to execute the action
Abstraction: Represents an interface that connects the two Classes.
Details: How the tool works

Goal - This principle aims at reducing the dependency of a high-level
Class on the low-level Class by introducing an interface.

# Bad Example (Tight coupling)
class MySQLDatabase:
    def connect(self):
        print("Connecting to MySQL...")

# Good Example (Follow DIP with abstraction)
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

app.start()
app.start()
